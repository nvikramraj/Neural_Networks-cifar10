# Neural_Networks-cifar10
A neural network that can differentiate between 10 elements.

This project compares between two different neural networks :

1st Model :

2 convolutional neural network and 3 linear neural network
Model1.py

2nd Model :

3 convolutional neural network and 1 linear neural network
Model2.py

Graph plotting :
Model_graph.py

Testing accuracy :
test_model1.py
test_model2.py

My website : https://nvikramraj.github.io/

Result :

Model 2 has more accuracy than Model 1 .
